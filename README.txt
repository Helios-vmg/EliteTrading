How to use:

1. Run the program.
2. Select "import data".
3. Select "set max stop distance". This value is used to trim the data when
   searching for trade routes. It's the maximum distance between stations that
   will be used to plan the route. Recommended: 70 ly. If you later change this
   value you'll have to recompute all routes to be able to search routes again.
4. Select "recompute all routes".

The program is now ready to search for routes. Use "find a route" to search for
routes. The program will search for the best route in a radius around a given
system that strikes a balance between profit and required play time to complete.
